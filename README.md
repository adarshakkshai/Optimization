# Optimization

This repository contains the assignment codes for course on Optimization. The codes are generated as per the math in "Numerical Optimization", Jorge Nocedal & Stephen J. Wright. The codes are written by a collective effort of Adarsh Akkshai, Matt Kingsinger and Hongjun Choi. The major chunk of the codes contains algorithms such as: BFGS, Linear Search, Backtracking Linear Search, Gradient Descent, Conjugate Gradient Descent, Merhortra's Predictor Corrector method, Soyster's Method and Ben-Tal Menirovski method.

The reports contain the detailed math used to solve the coursework problems. The codes are standalone and can be executed by cloning each of the folders completely.
