Final Statistics for MIP

------------------------

Final objective value               =  -1.00000000000000e+00

Final integrality gap (abs / rel)   =  0.00e+00 /   0.00e+00 ( 0.00%)

# of nodes processed                =        5

# of subproblems processed          =        6

Total program time (secs)           =       0.51447 (     0.514 CPU time)

Time spent in evaluations (secs)    =       0.08574
