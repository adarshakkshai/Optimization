Final Statistics for MIP

------------------------

Final objective value               =  -1.00000000000000e+00

Final integrality gap (abs / rel)   = -6.66e-16 /  -6.66e-16 (-0.00%)

# of nodes processed                =        7

# of subproblems processed          =       10

Total program time (secs)           =       1.43389 (     1.434 CPU time)

Time spent in evaluations (secs)    =       0.07743
